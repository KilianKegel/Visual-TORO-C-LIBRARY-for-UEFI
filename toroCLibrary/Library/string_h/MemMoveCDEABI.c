Synopsis
    #include <string.h>
    void *memmove(void *pDst, const void *pSrc, size_t n);
Description
    https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/memmove-wmemmove?view=msvc-160
    The memmove function copies n characters from the object pointed to by s2 into the
    object pointed to by s1. Copying takes place as if the n characters from the object
    pointed to by s2 are first copied into a temporary array of n characters that does not
    overlap the objects pointed to by s1 and s2, and then the n characters from the
    temporary array are copied into the object pointed to by s1.
Returns
    The memmove function returns the value of s1.

    @param[in]  void *pDst  buffer address
                void *pSrc
                size_t n    number of characters
